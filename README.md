# Palpo: A Rust Matrix Server Implementation

**Due to the ownership dispute initiated by Han regarding this organization, this repository will no longer be maintained or updated.**

To give everyone some context on what’s happening, I’m posting the info regarding the original controversy here. The following information can be found in the #general channel of the Robius Discord server.

**Han:**
Please take actions ASAP before we have to report the issue to the VP of open source at Huawei, Xudong Ren and make this misconduct public
I request restoring the owners roles to the previous Palpo owners (suhan1996, roewade), and please fork the repos to the Robrix organization if you are funding one of our previous core contributors to continue working on it without letting the rest of the team know.

**Chris:**
I would like to acknowledge @han.su. ’s sponsorship of the Palpo project in 2024, which totaled approximately $17,500. I am grateful for his past support of both Palpo and the open-source ecosystem.

It is important to clarify that this sponsorship was limited to the year 2024; there has been no sponsorship from 2025 to the present. To reflect this change and ensure Palpo’s continued independence, I have updated the membership of our GitHub organization.

Moving forward, Palpo remains open to new sponsorships, provided they do not compromise the project's autonomy. We also welcome forks that adhere to our open-source license and encourage contributors to merge back with the upstream repository.

2026 is a year of active growth for Palpo. Our primary objectives are to achieve compatibility with the majority of Matrix clients, integrate more user feedback, and expand our community presence.

Additionally, we have forked the Robrix project and renamed it Netrix. We are currently redesigning its interface to transform it into a distributed collaboration tool specifically for enterprise use.

Please note that I am not very active on Discord. For inquiries or technical issues, please contact me via WeChat, email, or by opening a GitHub issue.

Thank you for your continued interest and support.

**Han:**
Everyone in this server knows I founded Palpo. I invited @chrislearn to the team as a core contributor with a good amount of vested share if we attain revenue. If you’re leaving with new funding from Robrix, please fork the Palpo repos to Robrix org and continue working on the project, rather than removing all of our access.

I don’t think revoking our access to Palpo was an initiative of the Robrix team, but it seems closely tied to Chris’s recent funding from Robrix. Please take note of his misconduct, Palpo is founded by the Privoce team. I would appreciate the Robrix team ending the collaboration with Chris (a previous core contributor I invited to the team) while remaining free to fork the Palpo repositories to Robrix org.

Clarification of Facts Regarding Palpo Project

I would like to clarify the following facts:

Employment Status: At no point in time have I ever been an employee of Privoce.

Development & Contributions: I have been the sole developer of this project since its inception. This is fully verifiable via the GitHub commit history. Han’s involvement is limited to a few minor edits to the README file.

Work Commitments vs. Funding: Throughout 2024, I developed this project entirely in my spare time. Starting in 2025, I transitioned to full-time development. It is crucial to emphasize that the vast majority of the core work was completed before I received any form of sponsorship from him. Furthermore, since the beginning of 2025, Han has provided zero financial support.

Infrastructure: The test server and the palpo.im domain name were purchased and maintained entirely at my own expense.

Funding Discrepancies: I later learned that Futurewei had originally commissioned Han to find developers for a Matrix server-side project and provided approximately $150,000 in sponsorship specifically intended for the developers. However, I was kept completely in the dark about this. Han repeatedly claimed to me that there was no funding available or that it might only materialize in the future. Meanwhile, the personal "sponsorship" he provided to the project amounted to only about $17,500.
Investment & Labor: I have dedicated a massive amount of my personal time—countless days and nights—to this project, as evidenced by the GitHub activity. While Futurewei provided the capital (which Han seemingly misappropriated), I must ask: what exactly has Han contributed? It is clear who is actually attempting to hijack the fruits of the open-source community.

Technical Capacity: The claim that technical support was provided by Han’s "team" is utterly baseless. I am the author and maintainer of Salvo (salvo.rs), a framework with over 4,000 stars on GitHub and one of the most widely used Rust web frameworks, especially in China.

Finally, I wish to state this: my restraint was an act of tolerance, not a sign of weakness or an invitation to be bullied. Human greed is a reality, but it must have its limits.

The reason I removed Han and other members of Privoce from the organization is that despite having ceased all sponsorship for Palpo, Han continues to falsely claim to Futurewei that his company is still funding my project. I refuse to allow my hard work and contributions to be used as a tool for greedy individuals to secure illicit financial gain.

The core driving force of open source is neither to amass wealth nor to deceive others. It is fueled by a developer’s genuine passion for technology, not an obsession with money. Even now, I have never demanded compensation that exceeds the value of my technical contributions.

**Han:**
It’s never been your personal project, Privoce has various funding sources
You’re a contributor I invited to work on Palpo, otherwise how would you even know about Palpo? We have a whole team working on rust char server. Feel free to fork Palpo if you have any new funding

**Chris:**
As evident from Han’s response, there has been no clear refutation of the facts I stated above. This silence further validates the truth of my statements, and for me, that is more than enough.

**Han:**
We received much more funding for Palpo, but how much you got from me or the Robrix team does not change that we are the founder and owner of Palpo, the FW contract also clearly stated its with Privoce rather than you. There’s absolutely no right for you to remove the rest of the team no matter how much code you committed. You would have not even know about Palpo/Matrix without joining the Palpo project!
We will retain Palpo an open sourced project, so feel free to fork it to Robrix org.
